# Exchange Rate ðŸ’±

This project is a web page called "exchange-rate" that displays the current exchange rate between two currencies. The page has been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing DOM manipulation and API consumption.

The page allows the user to select two different currencies and display their current exchange rate. JavaScript has been used to make a call to an API that provides real-time exchange rate information. Additionally, DOM manipulation has been used to update the page with the exchange rate information.

The page has been designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive graphical interface that allows the user to select desired currencies and display their exchange rate. The design is responsive, meaning that it adapts to different screen sizes.

This project is ideal for those who want to learn how to use APIs and DOM manipulation in web projects, as well as those looking to improve their skills in web design and front-end development.
